# CAPTCHA Bypass Testing Tool

## Description

This tool is designed to test the effectiveness of CAPTCHA systems by attempting to solve text-based and audio-based CAPTCHA challenges using OCR and speech recognition techniques. It should be used responsibly for testing purposes only.

## Prerequisites

- Python libraries:
  - OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
  - Pytesseract (`pytesseract`)
  - NumPy (`numpy`)
  - SpeechRecognition (`SpeechRecognition`)
  - requests (`requests`)
- External software:
  - Tesseract OCR (install separately)

## Installation

1. Install Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pytesseract numpy SpeechRecognition requests
   ```
2. Install Tesseract OCR:
   - [Windows](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - [macOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tesseract)
   - [Linux](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki)

## Usage

1. Place your CAPTCHA files in the specified paths or modify the file paths in the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```python
   python captcha_tool.py
   ```

## Example

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # For text-based CAPTCHA
    text_captcha_path = 'captcha.png'
    captcha_text = solve_text_captcha(text_captcha_path)
    print(f'Solved Text CAPTCHA: {captcha_text}')
    
    # For audio-based CAPTCHA
    audio_captcha_path = 'captcha.wav'
    captcha_audio_text = solve_audio_captcha(audio_captcha_path)
    print(f'Solved Audio CAPTCHA: {captcha_audio_text}')
```

## Notes

- The tool's effectiveness depends on the quality of CAPTCHA images and audio files.
- Advanced CAPTCHA systems may require more sophisticated techniques.
- The audio solver uses Google's speech recognition service, requiring an internet connection.
